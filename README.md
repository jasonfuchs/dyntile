I write this project in order to learn the Wayland architecture and particularly the [`wayland-client`](https://crates.io/crates/wayland-client) to generate bindings for the [`river-layout-v3`](https://codeberg.org/river/river/src/branch/master/protocol/river-layout-v3.xml) protocol extention.

**I've just discovered that I've been using the crate wrong and will be rewriting this, please don't be frightend by my terrible code.**
